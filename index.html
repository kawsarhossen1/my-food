                <p>Mix the chicken breast with ginger & garlic paste. Fry them in a pan with 1 tsp of vegetable oil for

                <p>My most vivid memory of them was the time I was recovering from pneumonia, hadn't eaten anything for
                    3
                    weeks, and was allowed for the first time to sip some broth. And sip I did while the rest of the
                    family
                    ate beautiful, smoky, meaty, hearty, beefy kebabs.

                <p>An Indian party's snack platter is incomplete without this delicious appetizer dish of seekh kabab.
                    Succulent kebabs made with minced lamb, marinated in variety of spices, grilled on a tandoor/oven
                    and
                    served with green chutney.
